# Prediction Model for CCS National Qualifying Times (NQT)

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook, "Prediction Model CCS NQT.ipynb", is designed to analyze historical swimming data and predict future National Qualifying Times (NQT) for various swimming events. It provides a comprehensive framework for processing time data, applying machine learning models to understand trends, and predicting future performance benchmarks that athletes must meet to qualify for national championships.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this notebook is to offer coaches, athletes, and sports analysts a tool to forecast future qualifying standards in swimming competitions. By understanding these trends, swimmers can tailor their training to meet or exceed these future benchmarks, and coaches can adjust training programs accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Data Conversion:** Converts swimming times from a standard string format to a numerical format for analysis.
- **Prediction Models:** Utilizes linear and polynomial regression models to forecast future NQTs based on historical data.
- **Visualization:** Graphically represents historical times and predicted qualifying times, allowing for easy visualization of trends over the years.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Includes functionality to compare men's and women's event times side by side, highlighting differences in performance trends.

## How to Use

1. **Setup Environment:** Before running the notebook, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Clone or download this repository to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will ensure that all dependencies are installed and your environment is set up correctly.

2. **Data Input:** Enter the historical qualifying times for each swimming event in the prescribed dictionary format provided within the notebook.

3. **Model Selection:** Choose the prediction model (linear or polynomial regression) based on the data's nature and your analysis needs. The notebook guides you through selecting and applying the appropriate model for predicting future NQTs.

4. **Run Predictions:** Execute the notebook cells to generate predictions for future years. The notebook will use the data and selected model to forecast future qualifying times.

5. **Analyze Results:** Utilize the visualizations (graphs) generated by the notebook to examine the trends in qualifying times over the years. These insights can help swimmers, coaches, and analysts make informed decisions regarding training schedules and performance goals.
