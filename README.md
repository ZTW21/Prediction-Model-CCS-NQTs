# Prediction Model for CCS National Qualifying Times (NQT)

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook, "Prediction Model CCS NQT.ipynb", is designed to analyze historical swimming data and predict future National Qualifying Times (NQT) for various swimming events. It provides a comprehensive framework for processing time data, applying machine learning models to understand trends, and predicting future performance benchmarks that athletes must meet to qualify for national championships.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this notebook is to offer coaches, athletes, and sports analysts a tool to forecast future qualifying standards in swimming competitions. By understanding these trends, swimmers can tailor their training to meet or exceed these future benchmarks, and coaches can adjust training programs accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Data Conversion:** Converts swimming times from a standard string format to a numerical format for analysis.
- **Prediction Models:** Utilizes linear and polynomial regression models to forecast future NQTs based on historical data.
- **Visualization:** Graphically represents historical times and predicted qualifying times, allowing for easy visualization of trends over the years.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Includes functionality to compare men's and women's event times side by side, highlighting differences in performance trends.

## How to Use

1. **Data Input:** Enter the historical qualifying times for each swimming event in the prescribed dictionary format.
2. **Model Selection:** Choose the prediction model (linear or polynomial regression) based on the data's nature and your analysis needs.
3. **Run Predictions:** Execute the notebook cells to generate predictions for future years and visualize the data.
4. **Analyze Results:** Use the plotted graphs and predicted times to make informed decisions about training and performance goals.
